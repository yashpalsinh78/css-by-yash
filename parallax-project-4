                Paragliding is a recreational and competitive sport that involves flying in a paraglider, a lightweight, free-flying aircraft. The pilot sits in a harness suspended below a fabric wing, which is inflated by the wind and provides lift. Paragliders are launched by foot, usually from a hill or mountain, and can stay aloft for several hours, depending on the weather conditions.
                <br> <br>
                There are many different types of paragliding, such as cross-country, acro, and competition. Cross-country paragliding is the most popular form of the sport, and involves flying long distances to reach a specific destination. Acro paragliding is a type of flying that involves performing aerobatic maneuvers, such as loops and spins. Competition paragliding is a form of the sport that involves flying through a course and completing specific tasks, such as flying through gates or landing on a target.

            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a water sport that involves riding on the face of a wave while standing on a surfboard. It is typically done in the ocean, but can also be done on other bodies of water such as rivers and lakes. The goal of surfing is to ride the wave as long as possible, while maneuvering the board to perform tricks and stunts.
                <br> <br>
                There are different types of surfing, such as longboarding, shortboarding, and stand-up paddle surfing (SUP). Longboarding is done on a larger board, typically over 9 feet long, and is better suited for beginners or for riding smaller waves. Shortboarding is done on a smaller board, usually under 7 feet long, and is better suited for more advanced surfers who want to perform tricks and maneuvers. Stand-up paddle surfing (SUP) is a type of surfing where the surfer stands on a board and uses a paddle to propel themselves through the water.
